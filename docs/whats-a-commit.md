# What is a commit?

In Git, a commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in the repository at a particular point in time. A commit represents a new version of the codebase and includes a message describing the changes made in that version.

When you create a new commit, Git records a snapshot of the files in the staging area and stores it in the repository. This snapshot includes all the changes made since the last commit.

The commit message is an essential part of the commit. It describes the changes made in the commit and is used to track the progress of the project over time. A good commit message should be descriptive and provide enough information for others to understand the changes made in the commit.

The format of a Git commit history typically includes the commit hash, author information, commit message, and date/time of the commit. The commit hash is a unique identifier for the commit that Git uses to track changes to the codebase. The author information includes the name and email address of the person who created the commit. The commit message is a brief summary of the changes made in the commit. The date/time of the commit is the time when the commit was created.
