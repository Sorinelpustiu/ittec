# What is a Git repository?

A Git repository is a collection of files and directories that are managed by Git. It is a central location where all the changes made to the files are tracked, recorded, and stored.

In a Git repository, each file and directory has a unique history that shows all the changes made to them over time. The history is stored in the form of commits, which are snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time.

One of the primary benefits of using Git repositories is that they enable collaboration among developers. Multiple developers can work on the same repository at the same time, with each developer creating their own branch to make changes. Once changes are made, they can be merged back into the main branch, allowing for easy collaboration and code review.

Git repositories can be hosted locally on a developer's computer or remotely on a hosting service such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Remote hosting services allow developers to collaborate on code from anywhere in the world, making it easy to contribute to open-source projects and work with distributed teams.
