# What are git branches?

Git branches are an essential feature of Git that allows developers to work on different features or versions of the codebase simultaneously. In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that exists independently of the main codebase. It is like a separate copy of the repository that you can make changes to without affecting the main codebase.

By default, when you create a new Git repository, a single branch is created called "main." This branch contains the latest stable version of the codebase. However, you can create multiple branches from the "main" branch to work on new features or versions of the codebase.

Once you have made changes to a branch, you can merge those changes back into the "main" branch using the git merge command. This command combines the changes from the branch with the changes in the "main" branch.

Branches are particularly useful when working on a project with multiple developers. Each developer can work on their own branch and make changes without interfering with each other's work. Once the changes are tested and ready to be integrated into the main codebase, they can be merged into the "main" branch.

Git branches are separate lines of development that allow you to work on different versions or features of the codebase simultaneously. They are useful for collaboration, testing, and managing the development process.
